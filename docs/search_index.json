combines best-of-breed choices for UI, GraphQL (server and client), CSS and code bundling, handles server-side rendering (SSR) properly, and is fast and extensible.\nIt focuses on performance characteristics that you don't often find in other starter kits — offering Zopfli/Brotli compression, automatic vendor splitting, aggressive minification of JS/CSS, instant hot code reloading and fast time-to-first-byte (\nIt pairs an async web server for handling SSR, non-JS imports (like images, CSS, etc) and works universally. Your code will run both in the browser, and on the server — and you can import images/CSS just like regular Javascript.\nDevelopment, production and even static bundling can be invoked with just one command, via the ReactQL CLI.\nYou can easily bolt-on your own GraphQL server, or point to one off-site.\nIf you want to shave weeks off your next project boilerplate, try ReactQL.\nNew in 2.0.0: Full-stack GraphQL + React v16 streaming API\nWant to install quickly? Use the CLI - it does the heavy lifting for you.\nFeatures\nStack\n\nReactQL CLI for quickly starting a new project\nNew in 2.x: React v16 for UI\nNew in 2.x: Apollo Server for enabling the built-in GraphQL server\nApollo Client (React) for connecting to GraphQL\nReact Router 4 for declarative browser + server routes\nRedux for flux/store state management\n\nGraphQL\n\nNew in 2.x: Built-in GraphQL server via - just pass in your schema, and enable /graphql with a single line of code\nGraphiQL query browser enabled by default\nIsomorphic GraphQL client - await data via SSR before rendering HTML; query asynchronously in the browser\nAvoid network overhead with local GraphQL querying via apollo-local-query\nWrite .gql GraphQL query files, use fragments, or type queries inline.\n\nServer-side rendering\n\nBuilt-in Koa 2 web server, with async/await routing\nReact v16 with streaming API - time-to-first-byte as low as 4-5ms!\nFull route-aware server-side rendering (SSR) of initial HTML\nUniversal building - both browser + Node.js web server compile down to static files\nPer-request Redux stores. Store state is dehydrated via SSR, and rehydrated automatically on the client\nHTTP header hardening with Helmet for Koa\nDeclarative/dynamic  section, using react-helmet\nFull page React via built-in  component - every byte of your HTML is React!\n\nReal-time\n\nHot code reloading; zero refresh, real-time updates in development\nReact + Redux state preservation on hot reloading, to avoid interrupting your dev flow\nDevelopment web server that automatically rebuilds and restarts on code changes, for on-the-fly SSR testing with full source maps\n\nCode optimisation\n\nWebpack v3, with tree shaking -- dead code paths are automatically eliminated\nSeparate local + vendor bundles, for better browser caching/faster builds\nDynamic polyfills, courtesy of babel-preset-env\nAggressive code minification with Uglify\nGIF/JPEG/PNG/SVG crunching for images in production\nCSS code is combined, minified and optimised automatically - even if you use SASS, LESS and CSS together!\n\nStyles\n\nPostCSS v6 with next-gen CSS and inline @imports\nSASS and LESS support (also parsed through PostCSS)\nAutomatic vendor prefixing - write modern CSS, and let the compiler take care of browser compatibility\nMix and match SASS, LESS and regular CSS - without conflicts!\nCSS modules - your classes are hashed automatically, to avoid namespace conflicts\nCompatible with Foundation, Bootstrap, Material and more. Simply configure via a .global.* import to preserve class names\n\nHighly configurable\n\nNew in 2.x: Userland configuration.

This allows you to avoid writing classes with a render() method, if all you want to do is create a simple component.\nOn the flip-side, this will raise an error with the linter:\n// Don't do this -- it will result in a linting error!\nclass Button extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      Some text\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAlternatively, if you do want to use classes with a single render() method, extend from React.PureComponent and make sure you're using at least one of this.props or this.context to avoid linting errors-- this is especially useful if you want to use decorators, like this:\n@graphql(query)\n// This will work fine -- the linter will be happy\nclass GraphQLMessage extends React.PureComponent {\n  // It's okay to have a single `render` here, so long as we are extending\n  // from `React.PureComponent` and are using at least `this.props` or\n  // `this.context`\n  render() {\n    const { data } = this.props;\n    const message = data.allMessages && data.allMessages[0].text;\n    const isLoading = data.loading ? 'yes' : 'nope';\n    return (\n      \n        Message from GraphQL server: {message}\n        Currently loading?: {isLoading}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nMultiple React components per page\n\n\nGenerally, it's a good idea to give your React components their own .js file. But sometimes, you might write 'helper' components that won't get used outside a parent context.\nReactQL lets you write multiple components per file, without generating linter warnings.\nPropTypes must be valid\n\n\nReact propTypes should be a known shape-- 'any' is forbidden.\nThis gives you richer console messages in development in the event your React components are missing data, or receiving props they're not expecting.\nSingular fat-arrow params don't need brackets\n\n\nFat-arrow parameters need only be wrapped in parentheses when there's more than one of them.\nSo this is perfectly valid:\n// props, not (props)\nconst HOC = props => {props.message};\n\nWindows + Linux compatible line-breaks\n\n\nLine-break style can be either *nix (\\n) or Windows (\\r\\n).\nUnary operators allowed in `for` loops\n\n\nUnary operators ++ and -- are allowed as the final statement in a for loop.\ne.g. this is valid:\nfor (let count = 0; i \nFile extensions\n\n\nJSX can be written in both .js or .jsx files\nGlobal import/require is allowed\n\n\nSince we're targeting a universal code base in dev and production, there may be code you need to import conditionally. Therefore, require and import can be used globally.\nThis is valid:\nlet someModule;\n\nif (SERVER) {\n  // This will only ever get loaded on the server, and since the code path will\n  // be eliminated by Webpack on the browser, won't wind up in the browser bundle\n  someModule = require('someModule').default;\n}\n\n// `someModule` will be `undefined` in the browser, but a usable module on the server\n\nYou can also use import outside of top-level code, which will return a promise with the resolved module. This is useful for code-splitting:\nasync function getModule() {\n  try {\n    // get the code asynchronously - works in the browser and on the server!\n    const mod = await import('./someModule'); // \nModule resolution\n\n\nModule resolution first looks in our project root folder, and then node_modules, so we can write:\nimport Button from 'src/button.js';\n\n... wherever we are in the codebase, instead of requiring paths relative to the caller.\nReact self-closing tags\n\n\nReact self-enclosing tags should be on the same line as the final prop, e.g.:\n\n\n"},"writing_code/modules.html":{"url":"writing_code/modules.html","title":"Module resolution","summary":"Where ReactQL looks for your imported code","keywords":"","body":"Module resolution\n\nHow ReactQL finds your code\nWhen you import or require modules, Webpack (and ESLint) will first look in your root project folder before checking node_modules.\nThis allows you to short-hand writing long, relative path names.\ne.g. instead of writing:\nimport x from '../../../components/some/file.js';\n\n... you can instead simply write:\nimport x from 'src/components/some/file.js';\n\nThe same is true of any filetype that Webpack recognises- .jpg, .css, .sass, .json, etc:\n// If, say, you wish to put all CSS code in a `styles` folder in the project root\nimport style from 'styles/some/file.css';\n\n"},"writing_code/graphql.html":{"url":"writing_code/graphql.html","title":"GraphQL components","keywords":"","body":"React components with GraphQL data\n\nHow to write components that talk to a GraphQL server\nWhen running npm start and visiting the Webpack dev server at http://localhost:8080 you'll see an example of GraphQL talking to the built-in GraphQL server.\nYou can also visit http://localhost:8081/graphql and run queries against the sample schema, live!\n(Check out src/app.js to see how the GraphQL server is enabled in the default project, and how the GraphQL schema is pieced together.)\nThe cool thing is, if you visit your server-side web server at http://localhost:8081, you'll see the GraphQL response directly in the source code, too!\nThat's because ReactQL automatically requests data from GraphQL before rendering the resulting HTML back to the browser, in server mode -- whether the GraphQL server is 'local' to the web server or not.\nFurthermore, it will send back the initial Redux state with the HTML, too, ensuring that the browser doesn't re-request data it already has.\nHere's a blow-by-blow of how it works:\nFirst, set the GraphQL API endpoint.  You can elect to run a GraphQL server directly on top of the built-in Koa web server by running this code:\nconfig/project.js\n// Config API, for adding reducers and configuring our ReactQL app\nimport config from 'kit/config';\n\nif (SERVER) {\n  /* GRAPHQL */\n\n  // Enable the GraphQL server by passing in the schema.  Since we're running\n  // in an `if (SERVER)` block, we can be sure that `require()`'ing\n  // the schema won't 'bloat' our browser bundle\n  config.enableGraphQLServer(require('src/graphql/schema').default);\n}\n\nOr, if you're using an off-site GraphQL server, you can simply set the endpoint with:\nconfig/project.js\nimport config from 'kit/config';\n\nconfig.setGraphQLEndpoint('http://example.com/graphql');\n\nYou can save GraphQL queries to a .gql file and simply import them:\nsrc/graphql/queries/all_messages.gql\n#import \"./message.gql\"\n\nquery message {\n  message {\n    ...Message\n  }\n}\nIr use Apollo's gql template function to specify the data we require, inline.\nThen, in your React component, use the @graphql decorator to pass the GraphQL query, and its data will be made available to your component when it returns:\nsrc/components/graphql.js\nimport { graphql } from 'react-apollo';\n\nimport allMessages from 'src/graphql/queries/all_messages.gql';\n\n// Since this component needs to 'listen' to GraphQL data, we wrap it in\n// `react-apollo`'s `graphql` HOC/decorator and pass in the query that this\n// component requires.   Note: This is not to be confused with the `graphql`\n// lib, which is used on the server-side to initially define the schema\n@graphql(allMessages)\nexport default class GraphQLMessage extends React.PureComponent {\n  static propTypes = {\n    data: PropTypes.shape({\n      message: PropTypes.shape({\n        text: PropTypes.string,\n      }),\n    }),\n  }\n\n  static defaultProps = {\n    data: {\n      message: {\n        text: null,\n      },\n    },\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const { data } = this.props;\n\n    // Since we're dealing with async GraphQL data, we defend against the\n    // data not yet being loaded by checking to see that we have the `message`\n    // key on our returned object\n    const message = data.message && data.message.text;\n\n    // Apollo will tell us whether we're still loading.  We can also use this\n    // check to ensure we have a fully returned response\n    const isLoading = data.loading ? 'yes' : 'nope';\n    return (\n      \n        Message from GraphQL server: {message}\n        Currently loading?: {isLoading}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nIn this example, we're expecting a data.message object which will a text property, containing our message received from our built-in GraphQL endpoint.\nNow, we can use  inside any other React component, and it'll automatically update with props when data has been retrieved or is updated via Apollo.\nHow can I prevent data loading on the server?\nServer-side rendering is an awesome feature that will bolster your SEO strategy, and generally improve the user experience by making the full page available on initial render.\nHowever, sometimes you don't want or need all of the data to load at once. At times, this may slow down the user experience because the time-to-first-byte will be delayed until ALL GraphQL data is available.\nAt those times, you can tell Apollo not to load on the server, by specifying options on your graphql() HOC:\n@graphql(query, {\n  options: { ssr: false }, // won't be called during SSR\n});\n\nSee \"Skipping queries for SSR\" in the official Apollo docs for info.\n"},"stylesheets/":{"url":"stylesheets/","title":"CSS stylesheets","keywords":"","body":"Stylesheets\nReactQL supports plain CSS, SASS and LESS stylesheets.\nLike regular Javascript, you can import the above file types into your code directly, and classnames will be available on the imported object for use inside your React components.\nThis section describes how CSS works in ReactQL, and how code is optimised.\nLinks\n\nWriting CSS files.

Libraries and services such as prerender.io make it possible to simulate many of the benefits of server-side rendering, without writing code that targets a server platform.\nWhilst pre-rendering is generally a step up from serving 'headless' client bundles, 'real' SSR provides the ultimate experience for your users.\nHere are the key differences:\n\nData is often 'stale'. With pre-rendering, you're serving a cached version of the page, which could be minutes or hours out-of-date.  By contrast, ReactQL's SSR allows you to serve the 'real' request on demand, and offer content specific to that request.\n\nInitial HTML is often generic. Pre-rendering works by spawning a headless Javascript browser, loading the route, running Javascript on the page, and capturing the resulting DOM.  Since this happens en masse and not per visitor, you often forego the opportunity to personalise the HTML with data specific to the user.\n\nFlash of unstyled content or 'flicker' effects are commonplace. Since you're serving generic data and there's no server to pre-process data loading requests, DOM changes will often be made after the initial HTML is served.  This can lead to 'flicker' effects or content that suddenly gets style information applied, changing its position or look on the page.  By contrast, ReactQL sends down full, optimised CSS style information with the initial HTML, so content looks good immediately - and stays that way.\n\nNo heavy lifting by the server. A web server can strengthen the user experience by making asynchronous data requests to your GraphQL server or database, caching relevant information, or generally providing functionality that's not available on the client-side-- which can all add to the initial HTML sent down.  By contrast, pre-rendering doesn't have a 'web server'-- it blindly dumps back static HTML and leaves the rest to the client.\n\n\n"},"ssr/features.html":{"url":"ssr/features.html","title":"How ReactQL implements SSR","keywords":"","body":"How ReactQL implements SSR\n\nFeatures you get out-the-box\nReactQL includes a Koa web server. In production mode, the entry point Webpack will use to generate your web server code is kit/entry/server_prod.js. In development, it's kit/entry/server_dev.js\nIn both modes, navigating to a server route returns a full HTML dump to the client.\nAn example response-- notes below:\n\nThis demonstrates the following features:\n1.  re-winding\n\nThanks to React Helmet, you can declare  content anywhere inside your React chain, and it'll wind up in the resulting HTML.\nUse it like this:\n// React Helmet\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet';\n\n// Define  (i.e. ) settings anywhere\nconst Component = (\n  \n    \n  \n);\n\nHelmet makes it easy to add request-specific, dynamic titles and meta data.\n2. Pre-compiled CSS stylesheets\n\nStylesheets used anywhere in your app are optimised, minified and concatenated into a single file in production, which winds up in dist/public/assets/css/style.css.\n\nLearn more about ReactQL stylesheets here\n\nFiles ending in .scss or .sass as first processed by node-sass. Files ending in .css skip the SASS compilation step. Both types are then processed by PostCSS, using CSSNext rules.\nStylesheet code is heavily optimised, common CSS rules are combined, and browser prefixes are added automatically.\nAlthough it's generally a good idea to avoid loading styles that aren't relevant to the current route, the aggressive optimisation and automatic gzipping typically results in a very small style.css file. In the original starter kit, style.css.gz is just 317 bytes.\nGiven the small file sizes involved, it's generally okay to keep the css file as a blocking  in the resulting HTML. The effort of splitting stylesheets generally yields a low ROI, and can give way to a flash of unstyled content.\n3. React to HTML\n\nReact components that are active in the current route are rendered to HTML, and sent back to the browser inside the #main div, like so:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nReactQL uses ReactDOMServer's renderToString() method, allowing the browser to load the resulting HTML into the local bundle and continue serving further React changes on the client-side.\n\nBefore HTML is sent back to the browser, GraphQL queries are executed on the server asynchronously, and 'awaited'. See React components with GraphQL data for a how-to on writing components that require GraphQL data.\n\n4. Store dehydration (Redux)\n\nIf the server has already requested data from a third-party source like a GraphQL server, it makes little sense to repeat that same request on the client-side.\nInstead, ReactQL automatically sends down the 'state' of the application along with the initial HTML render.\nThe browser can then use this data to 'rehydrate' the state of the application, and continue from the point the server finished - without surplus API calls or unnecessary round-trips to a third-party resource.\nThe built-in Apollo Client (for React) uses Redux under the hood, for managing 'store' state and implementing its data loading and caching strategy.\nTo make it easier to manage your own application state, ReactQL includes custom instantiation code for managing Redux instead of relying on Apollo's implicit store state. This makes it trivial to add custom reducers, and share store state from the server to the client.\n\nReactQL includes built-in support for Redux Devtools in the browser\n\n5. Code bundling\n\nTwo client-side bundles are produced by the server config, and loaded by your browser:\n\nvendor.js. Third-party code from NPM modules that are used in the starter kit, or imported into your own code.\n\nbundle.js. Your own app code.\n\n\nVendor code is produced automatically from modules that appear in the node_modules folder. Any other code winds up in bundle.js.\n\nIf you use code-splitting, Webpack will produce additional files such as bundle.0.js, bundle.1.js, etc. These are loaded asynchronously as needed - you don't need to explicitly define a loading mechanism, Webpack will do this for you.\n\n"},"ssr/environment.html":{"url":"ssr/environment.html","title":"Environment awareness","keywords":"","body":"Environment awareness\n\nHow code knows whether it's running on the server, or in the browser\nSometimes you'll have code that needs to run in a browser, but get skipped on the server -- or vice versa.\nA typical example is jQuery, or any code that manipulates the DOM.

Multiple components could 'listen' to the current count, and update their UI based on, say, hitting a specific number. Or they could fire an action that would modify the state further. This simple example is surprisingly difficult to implement across an application with many React components, without a library like Redux to centrally manage 'state'.\nFor the rest of this section, I'm going to explain what's happening under the hood with another example: A to-do list.\nI encourage you to review the Redux documentation too, to get familiar with how Redux works. Rather than repeating concepts, I'll leave that to the library's author to tackle and instead focus on code.\n"},"state/reducers.html":{"url":"state/reducers.html","title":"Adding custom reducers","keywords":"","body":"Adding custom reducers\n\nA 'reducer' is a function that modifies the state of your application, and returns a copy.\nThis is what enables Redux to know that something has changed, and ultimately feed those changes back to any listening React components.\nThe first thing we need to do is create a reducer.\nSince we're building a simple to-do list, let's create a reducer that has two simple functions: Adding a to-do, and removing one. We'll create this at src/store/reducer.js, since we'll only have one reducer throughout our application (the name's not important; if we have more than one reducer, we might call it 'reducers/todo.js' or something similar.)\nsrc/store/reducer.js\n// Custom reducers.  We'll create a simple to-do list handler.\n\n// Export an object in the shape of { state, reducer()}  -- the\n// `state` part is our initial state, and `reducer()` is a function that modifies\n// the state when it receives a particular instruction -- like 'ADD_TODO'\n{\n  state: [],\n  reducer(state, action) {\n    // eslint-disable-next-line default-case\n    switch (action.type) {\n      case 'ADD_TODO':\n        if (action.todo && !state.includes(action.todo)) {\n          return [...state, action.todo];\n        }\n        break;\n      case 'REMOVE_TODO':\n        return state.filter(todo => action.todo !== todo);\n    }\n    return state;\n  }\n}\n\nWhat's happening here?\nRedux will pass in our current 'state' object. If we're calling this for the first time, we won't have an object, so we pass in a state key along with the export, which will become our initial state.\naction will contain whatever our action (which we've not yet built) passes to the reducer. We'll get to that in a moment, but for now let's assume it'll have an action.type string, which tells our reducer what to do with the state.\nIf action.type === 'ADD_TODO', then we check to ensure that same to-do item doesn't already exist on our state. If not, we'll create a new array, passing in all of the old values, along with our new to-do.\n\nNote: Creating a new array and not simply mutating the old one is a key concept of Redux. This allows us to keep our state 'clean' and free of side-effects, by each new action always resulting in a new/fresh copy of the state. We can then guarantee our React components are never relying on stale data, and it also makes it trivial to implement 'undo' features that travel back to previous states. ReactQL bundles seamless-immutable, which is a library that can turn plain Javascript objects/arrays into 'immutable' variants that can't be modified. You can examine the source code to see how that works.\n\nIf action.type === 'REMOVE_TODO', we'll pass back a new array with the todo filtered out. Again, note that we're not just removing it from the current array -- we pass back a fresh copy, just with that value omitted.\nOnce we've built our reducer, we need to add it to our Redux instantiation code that both the server and browser will use to wire up Redux.\nThat's easy to do:\nsrc/app.js\n// ...\n\n// Import the global `Config` singleton that ReactQL provides out-the-box\nimport config from 'kit/config';\n\n// Import the new reducer we've just created\nimport todoReducer from 'src/store/reducer.js';\n\n// Add the reducer by key\nconfig.addReducer('todos', todoReducer);\n\nNote that we've given the reducer object a todos root keyword. This means changes to the state will affect only that 'part' of the state. Apollo has its own apollo root, to avoid clashing with other 'parts' of our application state.\nThat's it - we now have a custom reducer that's concerned with responding to our to-do actions.\n"},"state/actions.html":{"url":"state/actions.html","title":"Adding actions","keywords":"","body":"Adding actions\n\nNow, we need to create a couple of simple 'actions' that will 'notify' our reducer when something needs changing.\nCreate a file called src/store/actions.js with this:\nsrc/store/actions.js\nexport function addToDo(todo) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    todo,\n  };\n}\nexport function removeToDo(todo) {\n  return {\n    type: 'REMOVE_TODO',\n    todo,\n  };\n}\n\nActions are super simple. They basically just return an object with a type key (that tells Redux what type of action this is) and then whatever other data we need to carry along with the request.\nRemember the switch() statement in our reducer that looks at action.type to respond to ADD_TODO and REMOVE_TODO?

This provides our functions with a 'higher-order component' that injects in state/action dispatching via props.\nWe then import our custom add/remove to-do actions.\nIn our  component, we use the connect function as a decorator. This function automatically passes a dispatch() function to our props. It's this function that allows us to tell Redux that an action has been triggered.\nWe wire up a simple form. The input registers itself on this.ref, which allows us to easily grab the value in the text box. The button fires off the dispatch event, with the text box value. The call to addToDo() returns a full object that then looks like this:\n{\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  todo: 'Whatever you entered in the input box'\n}\n\nThis gets fed down to our reducer, which returns back the 'new' state which now looks like this:\n[\n  'Whatever you entered in the input box'\n]\n\nIf you enter something new into the input box and hit the button again, the state would now be:\n[\n  'Whatever you entered in the input box',\n  'Something new that you entered'\n]\n\nSo, now we have our means to add to our state.\nWe then create the component that listens to the state -- our .\nHere, we use the same @connect decorator, but this time we pass in a function that tells connect which parts of our application state we want to listen to.\nSince we have access to the FULL state object (including the apollo root key!), and we only care about the todos key, we'll return an object with just that part.\nInside our component, we now have access to the todos via this.props.todos. Our component is then just basic Javascript - we check that this.props.todos isn't an empty array (if it is, we encourage the user to add a to-do) and display them as a  list.\nFinally, we wire up another action - this time the removeToDo - to change the state of the application once again.\n\nNote: Updating React components is done declaratively. We don't 'tell' React to update - the connect HOC automatically updates the props that are fed in to the component and thus React implicitly re-renders when the state data changes.\n\n"},"state/demo.html":{"url":"state/demo.html","title":"Running the demo","keywords":"","body":"Running the demo\n\nAfter designing our screens, we might have something that looks like this:\n\nIf we add a to-do to the input box and click the button, we get:\n\nPretty cool!\nBut even cooler, is that we can do the same on the server....\n"},"state/server.html":{"url":"state/server.html","title":"Server-side state","keywords":"","body":"Server-side state\n\nLet's imagine that our initial to-dos are loaded from a database, and we want to populate the first render back to the screen with those to-dos intact.\nIf we do this only in the browser, we might initially see a 'flicker' where the todos state object is empty, and then the  items suddenly populate at some time in the future whenever the data has been loaded.\nThat's not a great experience for the user, who may wonder why the list that says 'no to-dos' suddenly changes on them.\nInstead, let's inject the initial state on the server, and let the client automatically rehydrate this state for use in the browser.\nWe already have all of the pieces in play to do that - ReactQL does that out-the-box.

The kit has been tested on Windows 10, but will probably work on other versions, too. Environment variables and paths are written to be Windows-compatible.\n\nNote: Node.js is generally less performant on Windows vs. Mac or Linux distros, so expect build times to be up to 2-3x slower. This shouldn't generally affect your development environment (other than start-up times).\n\nWhat's missing?\n\nThere's currently no test library, so feel free to add your own.\nWill ReactQL play nicely with themes or other frameworks?\n\nReactQL provides UI, flux/app state, a web server, GraphQL, routing, code bundling and SASS/PostCSS stylesheets out the box. It should play nicely with any framework that isn't opinionated about any of those things.\nIf you're using a theme that's built on React, many times it will include its own competing build flow for the site -- e.g. Gulp for build tasks, LESS for stylesheets, Browsersync for hot code reloading, etc. The work involved in translating that flow to ReactQL can vary. It depends how tightly coupled the components are to the flow the author provides.\nTry to opt for components that are 'self-contained', that don't rely on specific build tools to compile. I'd encourage you to use components that you are in control of that don't require lots of third-party tooling, where possible. Sometimes, it makes sense to use HTML themes and manually translate to React instead.\nI'm using [insert database/back-end X here]. Will ReactQL work?\n\nReactQL is designed to consume GraphQL APIs, and includes its own built-in web server to serve HTML on the front-end. Despite coming bundled with a GraphQL server, it's completely agnostic about your back-end, and will connect to any API that can speak GraphQL.  It's up to you to define your GraphQL schema in a way that 'queries' whichever back-end you want to use.\nIf you're using a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, and you'd typically use REST to interact with a legacy system, consider building a GraphQL server that's designed to handle more dynamic requests instead.\nHow do I build a GraphQL server?\n\nNew in v2.0, ReactQL comes bundled with GraphQL server powers out-the-box. See this page for details on how it works.\n"},"support.html":{"url":"support.html","title":"Need support?","keywords":"","body":"Questions? Try Stack Overflow first\n\nStack Overflow is a community for helping developers. Post a question and include the reactql tag when asking your question, and it's likely you'll get a fast response.\n\nNote: ReactQL is a new framework, so if this tag doesn't already exist, you'll need 1,500+ reputation points on the site to create it. If you're new to S.O, simply use another tag, like 'react' or 'graphql' as needed\n\nIf your question is of a generic nature and doesn't relate strictly to ReactQL - for example, if it's more closely concerned with GraphQL, React or another piece of the stack - use related tags to solicit quicker responses from the wider community.\nSpotted a bug?\n\nRun into a problem with the reactql command line utility?
