best-of-breed choices for UI, GraphQL data fetching, CSS and code bundling, handles server-side rendering (SSR) properly, and is fast and extensible. You can choose Javascript or Typescript flavours.\nIt focuses on performance characteristics that you don't often find in other starter kits — offering Zopfli/Brotli compression, automatic vendor splitting, aggressive minification of JS/CSS, instant hot code reloading and more, out-the-box.\nIt pairs an async web server for handling SSR, non-JS imports (like images, CSS, etc) and works universally. Your code will run both in the browser, and on the server — even inline imports!  \nDevelopment, production and even static bundling can be invoked with just one command, via the ReactQL CLI.\nYou can easily bolt-on your own GraphQL server, or point to one off-site.\nIf you want to shave weeks off your next project boilerplate, try ReactQL.\nVideo: Intro to ReactQL\n\nIn this 15 minute video, Lee Benson (ReactQL author/maintainer) walks you through the headline features of ReactQL, and shows you how you can spawn a new project in one command:\n\nFeatures\n\nReactQL takes care of the tedious boilerplate, so you can focus on writing app code.

This allows you to avoid writing classes with a render() method, if all you want to do is create a simple component.\nOn the flip-side, this will raise an error with the linter:\n// Don't do this -- it will result in a linting error!\nclass Button extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      Some text\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAlternatively, if you do want to use classes with a single render() method, extend from React.PureComponent and make sure you're using at least one of this.props or this.context to avoid linting errors-- this is especially useful if you want to use decorators, like this:\n@graphql(query)\n// This will work fine -- the linter will be happy\nclass GraphQLMessage extends React.PureComponent {\n  // It's okay to have a single `render` here, so long as we are extending\n  // from `React.PureComponent` and are using at least `this.props` or\n  // `this.context`\n  render() {\n    const { data } = this.props;\n    const message = data.allMessages && data.allMessages[0].text;\n    const isLoading = data.loading ? 'yes' : 'nope';\n    return (\n      \n        Message from GraphQL server: {message}\n        Currently loading?: {isLoading}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nMultiple React components per page\n\n\nGenerally, it's a good idea to give your React components their own .js file. But sometimes, you might write 'helper' components that won't get used outside a parent context.\nReactQL lets you write multiple components per file, without generating linter warnings.\nPropTypes must be valid\n\n\nReact propTypes should be a known shape-- 'any' is forbidden.\nThis gives you richer console messages in development in the event your React components are missing data, or receiving props they're not expecting.\nSingular fat-arrow params don't need brackets\n\n\nFat-arrow parameters need only be wrapped in parentheses when there's more than one of them.\nSo this is perfectly valid:\n// props, not (props)\nconst HOC = props => {props.message};\n\nWindows + Linux compatible line-breaks\n\n\nLine-break style can be either *nix (\\n) or Windows (\\r\\n).\nUnary operators allowed in `for` loops\n\n\nUnary operators ++ and -- are allowed as the final statement in a for loop.\ne.g. this is valid:\nfor (let count = 0; i \nFile extensions\n\n\nJSX can be written in both .js or .jsx files\nGlobal import/require is allowed\n\n\nSince we're targeting a universal code base in dev and production, there may be code you need to import conditionally. Therefore, require and import can be used globally.\nThis is valid:\nlet someModule;\n\nif (SERVER) {\n  // This will only ever get loaded on the server, and since the code path will\n  // be eliminated by Webpack on the browser, won't wind up in the browser bundle\n  someModule = require('someModule').default;\n}\n\n// `someModule` will be `undefined` in the browser, but a usable module on the server\n\nYou can also use import outside of top-level code, which will return a promise with the resolved module. This is useful for code-splitting:\nasync function getModule() {\n  try {\n    // get the code asynchronously - works in the browser and on the server!\n    const mod = await import('./someModule'); // \nModule resolution\n\n\nModule resolution first looks in our project root folder, and then node_modules, so we can write:\nimport Button from 'src/button.js';\n\n... wherever we are in the codebase, instead of requiring paths relative to the caller.\nReact self-closing tags\n\n\nReact self-enclosing tags should be on the same line as the final prop, e.g.:\n\n\n"},"writing_code/typescript.html":{"url":"writing_code/typescript.html","title":"ES6 or Typescript?","keywords":"","body":"ES6 or Typescript?\nWhen you install a new project, you'll be asked whether you want to download the ES6 Javascript or Typescript version of the ReactQL starter kit.\nBoth kits maintain the same core feature set, and can be started and built in the same way.\nThere are a few differences:\nType checking\n\nThe Typescript variant includes type annotations, to help enforce structure and prevent common code bugs that occur when passing around unexpected data between functions. You can learn more at typescriptlang.org.\nThe ES6 version is 'plain', dynamically typed Javascript.\nWhich version you choose depends on the requirements of your project. If you're a sole developer or want to develop fast prototypes, ES6 is generally fewer keystrokes. If you're a team and want to enforce rigour across your app, type checking might be for you.\nBuild pipeline\n\nThere are subtle differences to the Webpack build process.\nThe Typescript version uses awesome-typescript-loader alongside the common Webpack build config, which both removes type annotations in the resulting bundle, and throws an error on type mismatches.\nThe ES6 Javascript version also throws syntax errors, but won't do any kind of type checking. It uses Babel to transpile ES6 to browser compatible code.\nBoth versions produce 'plain' Javascript for the server and browser; no runtime parser is needed.\nBundle sizes\n\nGenerally, resulting bundle sizes are relatively similar-- both ES6 and Typescript produced 'plain' Javascript that contains the appropriate polyfills to run properly in the browser, or via the Node.js web server. Bundle size alone is generally not a reason to choose one starter kit flavour over another.\nHowever, the Typescript version currently weighs in at around 11kb less than the ES6 variant, thanks for slightly more optimised helpers in Typescript vs. Babel and the lack of regenerator-runtime.\nReact / JSX\n\nTypescript files that use JSX / React syntax, should be suffixed with a .tsx extension. That tells the Webpack build pipeline to parse JSX properly.\nIn the ES6 kit, React can appear in any .js file -- no special extension is needed.\nKit sources\n\nDirect links to the relevant starter kit source repository:\n\nES6 version: https://github.com/reactql/kit\nTypescript version: https://github.com/reactql/kit.ts\n\n\nNote: You can clone the kit directly, or use the CLI tool to choose which flavour of kit you'd like when starting a new project.\n\n"},"writing_code/modules.html":{"url":"writing_code/modules.html","title":"Module resolution","summary":"Where ReactQL looks for your imported code","keywords":"","body":"Module resolution\n\nHow ReactQL finds your code\nWhen you import or require modules, Webpack (and ESLint) will first look in your root project folder before checking node_modules.\nThis allows you to short-hand writing long, relative path names.\ne.g. instead of writing:\nimport x from '../../../components/some/file.js';\n\n... you can instead simply write:\nimport x from 'src/components/some/file.js';\n\nThe same is true of any filetype that Webpack recognises- .jpg, .css, .sass, .json, etc:\n// If, say, you wish to put all CSS code in a `styles` folder in the project root\nimport style from 'styles/some/file.css';\n\n"},"writing_code/graphql.html":{"url":"writing_code/graphql.html","title":"GraphQL components","keywords":"","body":"React components with GraphQL data\n\nHow to write components that talk to a GraphQL server\nWhen running npm start and visiting the Webpack dev server at http://localhost:8080 you'll see an example of GraphQL talking to a live server end-point hosted at graph.cool\nCheck out src/app.js to see this working in action.\nThe cool thing is, if you visit your server-side web server at http://localhost:8081, you'll see the GraphQL response directly in the source code, too!\nThat's because ReactQL automatically requests data from GraphQL before rendering the resulting HTML back to the browser, in server mode.\nFurthermore, it will send back the initial Redux state with the HTML, too, ensuring that the browser doesn't re-request data it already has.\nHere's a blow-by-blow of how it works:\nFirst, set the GraphQL API endpoint.  By default, I've included a sample to a graph.cool service I created for this starter kit -- change this to your own GraphQL server in production:\nconfig/project.js\nexport const APOLLO = {\n  uri: 'https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/cinomw2r1018601o42x5z69uc',\n};\n\nBoth the browser and server entry points will create an Apollo client based on the above config.\nThen, in your src/app.js file, we define the GraphQL query to grab the data we need:\nsrc/app.js\n// First, create the GraphQL query that we'll use to request data from our\n// sample endpoint\nconst query = gql`\n  query {\n    allMessages(first:1) {\n      text\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nWe use Apollo's gql template function to specify the data we require.\nNext, we'll create the 'plain' component that will ultimately take the data in via props. Note: This doesn't have any 'special' GraphQL related syntax. It's just a plain React component that will take in GraphQL data via plain props:\nconst Message = ({ data }) => {\n  // `data` will initially be blank before GraphQL has returned with data, so test it exists\n  const message = data.allMessages && data.allMessages[0].text;\n  const isLoading = data.loading ? 'yes' : 'nope';\n  return (\n    \n      Message from GraphQL server: {message}\n      Currently loading?: {isLoading}\n    \n  );\n};\n\nNow, for use in development, we can add custom propTypes to the component so that React knows what to expect.\nIn this example, we're expecting an allMessages array which will contain an object with text property, containing our message received from our GraphQL endpoint.\n// Import from the `prop-types` lib\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\n\n// Add propTypes for React to expect data from GraphQL\nMessage.propTypes = {\n  data: PropTypes.shape({\n    allMessages: PropTypes.arrayOf(\n      PropTypes.shape({\n        text: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n      }).isRequired,\n    ),\n  })\n};\n\nFinally, we create a higher-order component that wraps our plain component, and gives it GraphQL listening powers:\nconst GraphQLMessage = graphql(query)(Message);\n\nNow, we can use  inside any other React component, and it'll automatically update with props when data has been retrieved or is updated via Apollo.\nHow can I prevent data loading on the server?\nServer-side rendering is an awesome feature that will bolster your SEO strategy, and generally improve the user experience by making the full page available on initial render.\nHowever, sometimes you don't want or need all of the data to load at once. At times, this may slow down the user experience because the time-to-first-byte will be delayed until ALL GraphQL data is available.\nAt those times, you can tell Apollo not to load on the server, by specifying options on your graphql() HOC:\nconst GraphQLMessage = graphql(query, {\n  options: { ssr: false }, // won't be called during SSR\n})(Message);\n\nSee \"Skipping queries for SSR\" in the official Apollo docs for info.\n"},"stylesheets/":{"url":"stylesheets/","title":"CSS stylesheets","keywords":"","body":"Stylesheets\nReactQL supports plain CSS, SASS and LESS stylesheets.\nLike regular Javascript, you can import the above file types into your code directly, and classnames will be available on the imported object for use inside your React components.\nThis section describes how CSS works in ReactQL, and how code is optimised.\nLinks\n\nWriting CSS files.

You might notice a flash of unstyled content as /bundle.js is first loaded before snapping your styles into place.\nThe ./static folder becomes your public route. Anything you might place in here - images, third-party scripts, etc - will be served 'unprocessed', in their original form.\nA small snippet of code will be added to your in-memory /vendor.js entrypoint for handling hot code reload via websockets. Whenever you make changes to your code, the browser is 'injected' with the code difference and reflected in real-time.\nDevelopment mode is not intended for production environments.

Libraries and services such as prerender.io make it possible to simulate many of the benefits of server-side rendering, without writing code that targets a server platform.\nWhilst pre-rendering is generally a step up from serving 'headless' client bundles, 'real' SSR provides the ultimate experience for your users.\nHere are the key differences:\n\nData is often 'stale'. With pre-rendering, you're serving a cached version of the page, which could be minutes or hours out-of-date.  By contrast, ReactQL's SSR allows you to serve the 'real' request on demand, and offer content specific to that request.\n\nInitial HTML is often generic. Pre-rendering works by spawning a headless Javascript browser, loading the route, running Javascript on the page, and capturing the resulting DOM.  Since this happens en masse and not per visitor, you often forego the opportunity to personalise the HTML with data specific to the user.\n\nFlash of unstyled content or 'flicker' effects are commonplace. Since you're serving generic data and there's no server to pre-process data loading requests, DOM changes will often be made after the initial HTML is served.  This can lead to 'flicker' effects or content that suddenly gets style information applied, changing its position or look on the page.  By contrast, ReactQL sends down full, optimised CSS style information with the initial HTML, so content looks good immediately - and stays that way.\n\nNo heavy lifting by the server. A web server can strengthen the user experience by making asynchronous data requests to your GraphQL server or database, caching relevant information, or generally providing functionality that's not available on the client-side-- which can all add to the initial HTML sent down.  By contrast, pre-rendering doesn't have a 'web server'-- it blindly dumps back static HTML and leaves the rest to the client.\n\n\n"},"ssr/features.html":{"url":"ssr/features.html","title":"How ReactQL implements SSR","keywords":"","body":"How ReactQL implements SSR\n\nFeatures you get out-the-box\nReactQL includes a Koa web server. In production mode, the entry point Webpack will use to generate your web server code is kit/entry/server_prod.js. In development, it's kit/entry/server_dev.js\nIn both modes, navigating to a server route returns a full HTML dump to the client.\nAn example response-- notes below:\n\nThis demonstrates the following features:\n1.  re-winding\n\nThanks to React Helmet, you can declare  content anywhere inside your React chain, and it'll wind up in the resulting HTML.\nUse it like this:\n// React Helmet\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet';\n\n// Define  (i.e. ) settings anywhere\nconst Component = (\n  \n    \n  \n);\n\nHelmet makes it easy to add request-specific, dynamic titles and meta data.\n2. Pre-compiled CSS stylesheets\n\nStylesheets used anywhere in your app are optimised, minified and concatenated into a single file in production, which winds up in dist/public/assets/css/style.css.\n\nLearn more about ReactQL stylesheets here\n\nFiles ending in .scss or .sass as first processed by node-sass. Files ending in .css skip the SASS compilation step. Both types are then processed by PostCSS, using CSSNext rules.\nStylesheet code is heavily optimised, common CSS rules are combined, and browser prefixes are added automatically.\nAlthough it's generally a good idea to avoid loading styles that aren't relevant to the current route, the aggressive optimisation and automatic gzipping typically results in a very small style.css file. In the original starter kit, style.css.gz is just 317 bytes.\nGiven the small file sizes involved, it's generally okay to keep the css file as a blocking  in the resulting HTML. The effort of splitting stylesheets generally yields a low ROI, and can give way to a flash of unstyled content.\n3. React to HTML\n\nReact components that are active in the current route are rendered to HTML, and sent back to the browser inside the #main div, like so:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nReactQL uses ReactDOMServer's renderToString() method, allowing the browser to load the resulting HTML into the local bundle and continue serving further React changes on the client-side.\n\nBefore HTML is sent back to the browser, GraphQL queries are executed on the server asynchronously, and 'awaited'. See React components with GraphQL data for a how-to on writing components that require GraphQL data.\n\n4. Store dehydration (Redux)\n\nIf the server has already requested data from a third-party source like a GraphQL server, it makes little sense to repeat that same request on the client-side.\nInstead, ReactQL automatically sends down the 'state' of the application along with the initial HTML render.\nThe browser can then use this data to 'rehydrate' the state of the application, and continue from the point the server finished - without surplus API calls or unnecessary round-trips to a third-party resource.\nThe built-in Apollo Client (for React) uses Redux under the hood, for managing 'store' state and implementing its data loading and caching strategy.\nTo make it easier to manage your own application state, ReactQL includes custom instantiation code for managing Redux instead of relying on Apollo's implicit store state. This makes it trivial to add custom reducers, and share store state from the server to the client.\n\nReactQL includes built-in support for Redux Devtools in the browser\n\n5. Code bundling\n\nTwo client-side bundles are produced by the server config, and loaded by your browser:\n\nvendor.js.

Apollo takes care of itself.\nBut what about other parts of your application? What if you want to store some kind of variables 'globally' across your app, and allow one or more React components to 'listen' to - or effect - the state?\nThat's where Redux comes back into play.\nLinks\n\nHow Redux works.  Brief overview of how the Redux library works, and how you can use it to manage state in your app.\n\nAn example: To-Do list.  For the rest of this section, we'll build a sample to-do list app that uses Redux to manage data that React components will use to update the to-dos.\n\nAdding custom reducers.

Actions trigger a state change that your reducers will handle.\n\nWiring up to React. Once we have our reducers and actions, it's time to wire them up to our React components to trigger and 'listen' to state.\n\nRunning the demo. Let's run the demo, and see Redux in action.\n\nServer-side state. Redux works on both the server and in the browser. Server state is 'dehydrated' and sent down the wire for the browser to 'rehydrate' and use as its initial state.\n\nRedux DevTools.

ReactQL is compatible with DevTools out-the-box.\n\n\n"},"state/redux.html":{"url":"state/redux.html","title":"How Redux works","keywords":"","body":"How Redux works\n\nRedux  is a library that adopts a Flux-like pattern, that allows you to trigger 'actions' that affect the global state. Any component 'listening' to state automatically re-render in response to changes:\n\nRedux adopts a similar pattern, but simplifies a lot of the boilerplate usually required to make this work.\nInstead of many 'stores' of state, your application has just one single state object, which you can apply 'reducers' to that affect changes to state.\n"},"state/example.html":{"url":"state/example.html","title":"An example: To-Do list","keywords":"","body":"An example: To-Do list\n\nIn the ReactQL examples repo, there's a 'No GraphQL, Just Redux' project that provides a full-blown example of implementing Redux.\nYou can clone this code, and run it locally.\nFor the rest of this section, I'm going to show you how to replicate this repo without removing GraphQL, so you can use the two side-by-side.\nI encourage you to review the Redux documentation too, to get familiar with how Redux works. Rather than repeating concepts, I'll leave that to the library's author to tackle and instead focus on code.\n"},"state/reducers.html":{"url":"state/reducers.html","title":"Adding custom reducers","keywords":"","body":"Adding custom reducers\n\nA 'reducer' is a function that modifies the state of your application, and returns a copy.\nThis is what enables Redux to know that something has changed, and ultimately feed those changes back to any listening React components.\nThe first thing we need to do is create a reducer.\nSince we're building a simple to-do list, let's create a reducer that has two simple functions: Adding a to-do, and removing one. We'll create this at store/reducer.js, since we'll only have one reducer throughout our application (the name's not important; if we have more than one reducer, we might call it 'reducers/todo.js' or something similar.)\nstore/reducers.js\n// Custom reducers.  We'll create a simple to-do list handler.\nexport default function reducer(state = [], action) {\n  // eslint-disable-next-line default-case\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      if (action.todo && !state.includes(action.todo)) {\n        return [...state, action.todo];\n      }\n      break;\n    case 'REMOVE_TODO':\n      return state.filter(todo => action.todo !== todo);\n  }\n  return state;\n}\n\nWhat's happening here?\nRedux will pass in our current 'state' object. If we're calling this for the first time, we won't have an object, so by default we create an empty state array.\naction will contain whatever our action (which we've not yet built) passes to the reducer. We'll get to that in a moment, but for now let's assume it'll have an action.type string, which tells our reducer what to do with the state.\nIf action.type === 'ADD_TODO', then we check to ensure that same to-do item doesn't already exist on our state. If not, we'll create a new array, passing in all of the old values, along with our new to-do.\n\nNote: Creating a new array and not simply mutating the old one is a key concept of Redux. This allows us to keep our state 'clean' and free of side-effects, by each new action always resulting in a new/fresh copy of the state. We can then guarantee our React components are never relying on stale data, and it also makes it trivial to implement 'undo' features that travel back to previous states.\n\nIf action.type === 'REMOVE_TODO', we'll pass back a new array with the todo filtered out. Again, note that we're not just removing it from the current array -- we pass back a fresh copy, just with that value omitted.\nOnce we've built our reducer, we need to add it to our Redux instantiation code that both the server and browser will use to wire up Redux.\nEdit kit/lib/redux.js by importing your reducer and adding it to the combineReducers() object that you're passing:\nkit/lib/redux.js\n// ...\n\n// Import the new reducer we've just created\nimport todoReducer from 'store/reducer';\n\n// ...\n\n// Add it to the existing `combineReducers()` call, alongside Apollo\nexport default function createNewStore(apolloClient) {\n  const store = createStore(\n    combineReducers({\n      apollo: apolloClient.reducer(),\n      todos: todoReducer, //  f,\n    ),\n  );\n\n  return store;\n}\n\nNote that we've given the reducer object a todos root keyword. This means changes to the state will affect only that 'part' of the state. Apollo has its own apollo root, to avoid clashing with other 'parts' of our application state.\nThat's it - we now have a custom reducer that's concerned with responding to our to-do actions.\n"},"state/actions.html":{"url":"state/actions.html","title":"Adding actions","keywords":"","body":"Adding actions\n\nNow, we need to create a couple of simple 'actions' that will 'notify' our reducer when something needs changing.\nCreate a file called store/actions.js with this:\nstore/actions.js\nexport function addToDo(todo) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    todo,\n  };\n}\nexport function removeToDo(todo) {\n  return {\n    type: 'REMOVE_TODO',\n    todo,\n  };\n}\n\nActions are super simple. They basically just return an object with a type key (that tells Redux what type of action this is) and then whatever other data we need to carry along with the request.\nRemember the switch() statement in our reducer that looks at action.type to respond to ADD_TODO and REMOVE_TODO?

This provides our functions with a 'higher-order component' that injects in state/action dispatching via props.\nWe then import our custom add/remove to-do actions.\nIn our  component, we use the connect function as a decorator. This function automatically passes a dispatch() function to our props. It's this function that allows us to tell Redux that an action has been triggered.\nWe wire up a simple form. The input registers itself on this.ref, which allows us to easily grab the value in the text box. The button fires off the dispatch event, with the text box value. The call to addToDo() returns a full object that then looks like this:\n{\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  todo: 'Whatever you entered in the input box'\n}\n\nThis gets fed down to our reducer, which returns back the 'new' state which now looks like this:\n[\n  'Whatever you entered in the input box'\n]\n\nIf you enter something new into the input box and hit the button again, the state would now be:\n[\n  'Whatever you entered in the input box',\n  'Something new that you entered'\n]\n\nSo, now we have our means to add to our state.\nWe then create the component that listens to the state -- our .\nHere, we use the same @connect decorator, but this time we pass in a function that tells connect which parts of our application state we want to listen to.\nSince we have access to the FULL state object (including the apollo root key!), and we only care about the todos key, we'll return an object with just that part.\nInside our component, we now have access to the todos via this.props.todos. Our component is then just basic Javascript - we check that this.props.todos isn't an empty array (if it is, we encourage the user to add a to-do) and display them as a  list.\nFinally, we wire up another action - this time the removeToDo - to change the state of the application once again.\n\nNote: Updating React components is done declaratively. We don't 'tell' React to update - the connect HOC automatically updates the props that are fed in to the component and thus React implicitly re-renders when the state data changes.\n\n"},"state/demo.html":{"url":"state/demo.html","title":"Running the demo","keywords":"","body":"Running the demo\n\nNow if we fire up our project with npm start, we see this:\n\nIf we add a to-do to the input box and click the button, we get:\n\nPretty cool!\nBut even cooler, is that we can do the same on the server....\n"},"state/server.html":{"url":"state/server.html","title":"Server-side state","keywords":"","body":"Server-side state\n\nLet's imagine that our initial to-dos are loaded from a database, and we want to populate the first render back to the screen with those to-dos intact.\nIf we do this only in the browser, we might initially see a 'flicker' where the todos state object is empty, and then the  items suddenly populate at some time in the future whenever the data has been loaded.\nThat's not a great experience for the user, who may wonder why the list that says 'no to-dos' suddenly changes on them.\nInstead, let's inject the initial state on the server, and let the client automatically rehydrate this state for use in the browser.\nWe already have all of the pieces in play to do that - ReactQL does that out-the-box.

I use this stuff every day in production, so you can be confident it'll be maintained and updated regularly.\nUse ReactQL if you want to skip the set-up, and get your next project up in record time.\nWhere do I start coding?\n\nsrc/app.js is the main React component, that both the browser and the serve will look to. Overwrite it with your own code.\nIf you need to edit the build defaults, you can start digging into the kit dir which contains the 'under the hood' build stuff.  But that generally comes later.\nIs this production ready?\n\nSome of the third-party packages in my stack may be in beta or pre-beta stages, so it's up to you to evaluate if they're a good fit for your application.\nI personally use this starter kit as a basis for several heavy product loads-- so I'm quite comfortable with the tech choices.\nWhat kind of projects is ReactQL a good starter for?\n\nAnything 'front end' that's backed by a GraphQL server. I typically break my projects down into a few pieces:\n\nFront end, with a built-in web server that serves public traffic. This usually sits behind an Nginx proxy/load balancer and compiles and dumps back the UI. This is basically ReactQL.\n\nGraphQL API. This could be Node.js, Python, Go, etc. But it's usually separate to the front-end code base, and is something the front-end talks to directly via the Apollo GraphQL client. I generally don't use ReactQL for this unless there's a good reason to build a monolithic app (e.g. speed, the back-end not doing a whole lot, etc.)\n\nMicroservices.  Smaller pieces of the stack that do one thing, and do it well. The API server is responsible for talking to this stuff.  Again, ReactQL doesn't really get a look in.\n\n\nI'd generally recommend a similar layout to keep your code light and maintainable.\nWith that said, if you want Node.js to handle both your front and back-office concerns, there's no reason you couldn't add a GraphQL server to kit/entry/server.js and handle your API requests from the same host.\nYou can see an example of adding a GraphQL server here\nIs this Windows compatible?\n\nYes. The kit has been tested on Windows 10, but will probably work on other versions, too. Environment variables and paths are written to be Windows-compatible.\n\nNote: Node.js is generally less performant on Windows vs. Mac or Linux distros, so expect build times to be up to 2-3x slower. This shouldn't generally affect your development environment (other than start-up times).\n\nWhat's missing?\n\nThere's currently no test library, so feel free to add your own.\nWill ReactQL play nicely with themes or other frameworks?\n\nReactQL provides UI, flux/app state, routing, code bundling and SASS/PostCSS stylesheets out the box. It should play nicely with any framework that isn't opinionated about any of those things.\nIf you're using a theme that's built on React, many times it will include its own competing build flow for the site -- e.g. Gulp for build tasks, LESS for stylesheets, Browsersync for hot code reloading, etc. The work involved in translating that flow to ReactQL can vary. It depends how tightly coupled the components are to the flow the author provides.\nTry to opt for components that are 'self-contained', that don't rely on specific build tools to compile. I'd encourage you to use components that you are in control of that don't require lots of third-party tooling, where possible. Sometimes, it makes sense to use HTML themes and manually translate to React instead.\nI'm using [insert database/back-end X here]. Will ReactQL work?\n\nReactQL is designed to consume GraphQL APIs, and includes its own built-in web server to serve HTML on the front-end. It's completely agnostic about your back-end, and will connect to any API that can speak GraphQL.\nIf you're using a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, and you'd typically use REST to interact with a legacy system, consider building a GraphQL server that's designed to handle more dynamic requests instead.\nHow do I build a GraphQL server?\n\nGraphQL is a layer 'above' an existing database. It's agnostic about your back-end technology or stack, and simply defines the shape of queries it will accept. It's up to you to define how data is retrieved. There's lots of community tooling to handle translating queries to SQL, handling data loading, caching, etc.\nCheck out Awesome GraphQL for a list of current libraries and resources for your back-end platform.\nFWIW, I generally use Apollo Server (Node.js) and Graphene (Python) in my own projects for building GraphQL servers.\n\nReactQL is intended for apps that consume GraphQL, rather than supply it. Creating a GraphQL server is a back-end concern that's outside of the scope of this starter kit. However, adding one to your existing server - if that's what you want to do - is trivial.
